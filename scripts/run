#
# This script provides a single entry point for the Contact Suite CLI.
# It runs the Python CLI tool from the scripts directory.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/run dev              # Start development environment
#   ./scripts/run test             # Run all tests
#   ./scripts/run health           # Check service health
#   ./scripts/run --help           # Show all commands

set -euo pipefail

# Get the project root directory (parent of scripts/)
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
PROJECT_ROOT="$(dirname "$SCRIPT_DIR")"

# Run the CLI as a Python module from the project root
# The -m flag ensures 'scripts' package is found correctly
cd "$PROJECT_ROOT" && exec python3 -m scripts.cs_cli "$@"
